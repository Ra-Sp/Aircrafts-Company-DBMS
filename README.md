My class 12 School Team Project

Front End: Python (version: 3.8, 32-bit)
Back End: MySQL + Python

The objective of this project is to make the management of data concerning the aircraft staff and passengers easier. We have the following modules that allow the user to:
  * Insert
  * Display
  * Update
  * Delete data related to :
          * Passengers
          * Pilots
          * Crew members

This project not just helps manage the above data, but also selects efficient pilots and crew members for any given flight. It also selects an appropriate aircraft on the basis of number of passengers.
