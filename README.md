The objective of this project was to make the management of data concerning the aircraft staff and passengers easier. 
We have the following modules that allow the user to:

  * Insert
  * Display
  * Update
  * Delete data related to :
  
          * Passengers
          
          * Pilots
          
          * Crew members
          

This project helps manage the above data and selects efficient pilots and crew members for any given flight. It also selects an appropriate aircraft on the basis of number of passengers.
